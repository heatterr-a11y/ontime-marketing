OnTime Marketing

Sync Reality. Eliminate Latency.

OnTime Marketing is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that demonstrates temporal synchronization between intent, decision, and outcome across digital systems.

This project functions as:
	•	A live interactive product demo
	•	An installable investor presentation deck
	•	An offline-capable PWA
	•	A temporal systems concept prototype

Overview

Modern systems react too late. Latency creates missed opportunities.

OnTime models a synchronized infrastructure where:
	•	Intent propagates instantly
	•	Decisions align in real time
	•	Outcomes occur precisely when they should

This repository contains the interactive demo powering that concept.
